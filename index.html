        <p>I've been doing Common Lisp related work intensively for 14 years, including more than a decade of Common Lisp Open Source. I am a top Common Lisp Open Source contributor. I am the sole author and maintainer of <a class="body-link" href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/" target="_blank">30 ready-to-use Public Domain Common Lisp libraries in Quicklisp</a>. I made the <a class="body-link" href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">modern public domain CLOS MOP specification</a>, one of our most important resources, based on Robert Strandh's work, itself based on AMOP. I am the sole author and maintainer of multiple important Common Lisp community resources such as the <a class="body-link" href="https://common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">Common Lispers list</a>, the <a class="body-link" href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/articles/common-lisp-format-reference/clhs-summary/#subsections-summary-table" target="_blank">epic FORMAT table</a>, and the still incomplete yet already useful "<a class="body-link" href="https://notes-and-tips.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">Notes and tips: Standard Common Lisp symbols</a>" article.</p>

        <p>See all my contributions at <a class="body-link" href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft</a>, which is now the <a class="body-link" href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hexstreamsoft.com" target="_blank">#1 Common Lisp site according to Alexa</a> as of October 2020. As of 14 november 2020, <a class="body-link" href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft</a> has been trending upwards for <a class="body-link tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1328049591242149889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">70+ consecutive days</a> (with 2 trivial exceptions), <a class="body-link" href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hexstreamsoft.com" target="_blank">is now in the top 202k</a>, and the absolutely insane site engagement metrics <a class="body-link tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1310714016273182720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">peaked</a> at 14 daily pageviews per visitor, 25:17 daily time on site and 24.8% bounce rate on 28 september 2020, indicating intense interest in my work.</p>

        <p>
          I am spearheading the nascent movement to <a class="body-link tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>. I believe this is eminently achievable given proper approaches.
          <br />
          Please support me on <a class="body-link" href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a>! My profile there provides a good overview of my Common Lisp Open Source work.</p>

        <p>I am interested in <a class="body-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hexstream" target="_blank">connecting</a> with (almost) everyone interested in Common Lisp! Regardless, feel free to reach out should you perceive fruitful avenues for collaboration.</p>

        <p>I have more than a decade of experience with Linux, Emacs, touch typing Dvorak (currently 80 wpm) on TypeMatrix 2030 and <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/tools/stumpwm/" target="_blank">StumpWM</a>, an emacs-like tiling window manager written in Common Lisp.</p>

        <p>I recently switched to the <a class="body-link" href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, which is at least 20x better than the TypeMatrix 2030. I am using <a class="body-link" href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">a heavily customized, original configuration of my own design</a>. I highly recommend the <a class="body-link" href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> to all serious computer professionals.</p>

        <p>I also have extensive experience writing responsive websites in raw standards-compliant semantic HTML5, CSS3 and progressively-enhanced unobstrusive JavaScript. (I would greatly prefer to write it all in Common Lisp, but my infrastructure is not there yet.) I created and am managing <a class="body-link" href="https://abc.hexstream.xyz/websites/" target="_blank">25+ subdomains across 3 main websites</a> and my uptime is at or around 100% every month according to <a class="body-link" href="https://status.abc.hexstream.xyz/" target="_blank">my custom public global status page</a>. All my sites are currently hosted on one 5$/month <a class="body-link" href="https://m.do.co/c/bfc912309da5" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> VPS behind <a class="body-link" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a>, with plenty of capacity to spare. I am looking to <a class="body-link tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1290414829287735302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">migrate</a> to <a class="body-link" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Workers</a>.</p>

              <p>
                I open-sourced 100% of my completely undocumented and effectively unusable code from my Hexstream Software (BahagonTools) era, first under the MIT license and then quickly under the Unlicense (public domain).
                <br />
                For several years I planned to improve these codebases to make them usable, but my skills having substantially improved, I eventually <a class="body-link tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1171593330460909569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reviewed and deleted 48 old projects I no longer care about</a>.
                <br />
                I redirected my efforts towards <a class="body-link" href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/" target="_blank">my newer, suitably engineered, documented, actually worthwhile projects</a>.</p>

              <p>
                Having learned from past mistakes, I now specialize in micro-libraries, with growing success in adapting my extreme modularity skills to bigger, higher impact projects.
                <br />
                I am finally achieving traction and accelerating momentum in completing <a class="body-link" href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">my exciting roadmap</a>.</p>

              <p>Weird era of surprisingly advanced programming using nascent software engineering and project management skills, entirely on my own. Several pearls in a sea of dreck.</p>

              <p>While working on my BahagonTools mega-project (tools for players of the Bahagon MMORPG), I spent almost all my time doing pure Common Lisp R&amp;D while building my own advanced (but badly engineered) web framework from scratch (using Hunchentoot for basic HTTP). I became a Common Lisp expert almost entirely by reading the CLHS and writing my own web framework.</p>

              <p>I single-handedly designed and implemented the following from scratch:</p>

              <p>- Several DSLs, for HTML, CSS, HTML rewriting, form validation and a bunch of other things, compiling to closures being a favorite technique. Declarative Programming is the ultimate paradigm!</p>

              <p>- An HTML rewriting and injection system. This greatly simplified and automated the writing of new static and/or dynamic pages while eschewing unnecessary layers of fake "abstraction".</p>

              <p>- A server-side form validation system notably featuring efficient declarative rete-based merging of error messages.</p>

              <p>- "flexiconf", a fully declarative configuration management system notably featuring bijective macros and the ability to load a configuration, modify it in-memory and then dump it back in the appropriate files, preserving all the appropriate structure and abstractions, thus supporting the full configuration evolution cycle.</p>

              <p>- A 25-tables SQL schema using Postgres.</p>

              <p>- An authentication system. The passwords were stored hashed and salted.</p>

              <p>- Tons of other cool stuff!</p>

              <p>Version control evolution: none, subversion monorepo, darcs monorepo, git monorepo, one git repo per project.</p>

              <p>I did successfully launch BahagonTools in early 2010, the site worked but was an utter commercial failure. The eventual goal was going freemium but no premium features were ever implemented. I took the site down after a few months due to lack of interest and prohibitive hosting costs: 80$/month for a dedicated server.</p>

              <p>Grade: Best of my class in programming</p>

              <p>Activities and Societies: Club Info</p>

              <p>I programmed even more BETWEEN courses (at home and at school, and between semesters) than within my programming courses.</p>

              <p>I started building crude GUI apps on my own while others were still using the console and JOptionPane. My BahagonTools app eventually reached a fairly high level of polish, the most advanced tool being a combat report analyzer featuring a custom list item renderer.</p>

              <p>I fairly often helped others with programming, especially in the beginning, and I once gave an impromptu presentation to most of the class about the clear superiority of Eclipse over NetBeans, which was very well-received and also impressed the teacher. (I proceeded to install Eclipse dozens of times on school workstations over the years.)</p>

              <p>I introduced and explained the concept of an event loop to one of my computer science teachers. 😂</p>

              <p>
                I dropped out for personal reasons.
                <br />

              <h1><a href="https://common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/#Pascal_Costanza" target="_blank">Pascal Costanza</a></h1>

              <p>I'd like to highlight one of Pascal's many important contributions to the Common Lisp community.</p>

              <p>Pascal is the author and maintainer of <a class="body-link" href="https://github.com/pcostanza/closer-mop" target="_blank">closer-mop</a>, demonstrably one of the most important Common Lisp libraries. Indeed, according to official Quicklisp downloads statistics, closer-mop was #2 in terms of direct and indirect downloads for 5 consecutive months beginning October 2017. As of January 2020, more than 100 libraries directly depend on closer-mop, which represents more than 5% of libraries in Quicklisp.</p>

              <p>closer-mop is a compatibility layer that smoothes out many unfortunate differences between implementations of the <a class="body-link" href="https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">Metaobject Protocol (MOP)</a> across several Common Lisp implementations. The CLOS MOP is one of Common Lisp's crown jewels, it is the single most important de-facto standard extension to Common Lisp, and it remains one of Common Lisp's most distinguishing features to this day. Were it not for Pascal's diligent work, the MOP would probably be impractical enough to use to be mostly of academic interest, whereas closer-mop enables everyone to confidently innovate using this feature almost as if it had been part of the Common Lisp standard all along.</p>

              <p>Pascal's work deserves greater recognition.</p>
